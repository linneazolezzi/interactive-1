    <div class="left-body" style="color: white"> 
      <p>Since 2000,[26][27] the Pantone Color Institute has declared an individual color 
      "Color of the Year". Twice a year, the company hosts a secret meeting of 
      representatives from the nations' color standards groups in a European capital. 
      After two days of presentations and debates, the representatives decided on a color
      for the following year. For example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in
      London in the spring of 2012.[28] <span class="end">&nbsp; </span> The selected color purportedly connects with 
      the zeitgeist.[29] For example, when they declared Honeysuckle the color of 2011, 
      the press releas said, "In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. 
      Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going – 
      perfect to ward off the blues."[30] The results of the meeting are published in 
      Pantone View, which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented 
      companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products.
      [28] In 2016 and 2021, Pantone chose two colors for Color of the Year. <span class="end">&nbsp; </span> In 2012, the
      color of the year, Tangerine Tango, was used to create a makeup line, in partnership 
      with Sephora.[46] The product line, named Sephora + Pantone Universe collection, 
      features Tangerine Tango–embellished false lashes, nail lacquers, cream, glitters, 
      and high-pigment lip glosses.[47] 2013 Emerald color was reported to be out of 
      sRGB gamut.[48] Also new Very Peri color of 2022 is present in TCX (dyed cotton 
      reference) and TPG (Textile Paper – "Green"[49]) form, here TCX for the sRGB hex 
      values are mentioned. <span class="end">&nbsp; </span> The executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, Leatrice Eiseman, is the person behind Pantone's Color of the Year. Leatrice Eiseman explained in an interview how 2014's Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen:</p>
      <p class="under" style="margin-left: 269px; color: #7CC4C4">
        I look for ascending color trends, colors that are being used in broader ways and broader context than before ... In this case, Radiant Orchid descends from the purple family, which is kind of a magical color that denotes creativity and innovation. Purple is just that kind of a complex, interesting, attracting kind of color ... [The] back-story to purple is that it inspires confidence in your creativity, and we're living in a world where that kind of creative innovation is greatly admired. In the world of color, purple is an attention-getter, and it has a meaning. It speaks to people, and we felt that it was time for the purple family to be celebrated. That's why we chose the particular shade called Radiant Orchid.<br>L. Eiseman[50]<br></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px">Pantone has said that color "has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times."[27]</p>
