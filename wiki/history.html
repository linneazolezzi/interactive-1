    <div class="left-body" style="color: white"> 
      <p>Pantone began in New Jersey in the 1950s as the commercial printing 
          company of brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine under their company, M & J Levine Advertising.[5][6] In 1956, the founders, both advertising executives, hired the recent Hofstra University graduate Lawrence Herbert as a part-time employee. Herbert used the knowledge he had learned in chemistry to systematize and simplify the company's stock of pigments and production of colored inks; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was $50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company's technological assets from the Levine Brothers for $50,000 (equivalent to $480,000 in 2022) and renamed them "Pantone".[7]</p>

        The company's primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6×2 inches or 15×5 cm) thin cardboard or plastic sheets, printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small "fan deck". For instance, a particular "page" might contain several yellows of varying tints.[citation needed][8]

      <p>The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to "color match" specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time.[citation needed][9] Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.[10] </p>

        Falling-Out with Adobe </p>
        <p class="btw" style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: 0em; color: #009473">
        In 2022, a dispute between Pantone and Adobe resulted in the removal of Pantone color coordinates from Photoshop and Adobe's other design software, causing colors in graphic artists' digital documents to be replaced with black unless artists paid Pantone a separate $15 monthly subscription fee.[11] Artists accused Pantone and Adobe of holding their work hostage. UK artist Stuart Semple responded by releasing FREETONE, a freeware clone of Pantone's color lists for use with Adobe software.[12][11]</p>
