      <p style="width: 640px;">On September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System.[19] This system consisted of 2058 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, as well as interactive software, tools, and an online community where the many users were able to share their various color swatches and their information.</p>

        The Goe system was then streamlined to use fewer base colors. Ten colors, plus clear coating for reflections were streamlined and only four of those base colors were new. The Goe system was also streamlined to accommodate the many technical challenges that are faced when reproducing colors on a press.[14]

      <p class="indented" style="margin-left: 536px; color: white; width: 500px;">
        The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013, but 4 new base colors were added into PMS and some of new colors too, though those 4 base colors are harder to purchase.[16]      </p>
