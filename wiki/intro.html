      <p>Pantone LLC (stylized as PANTONE) is an American limited liability company headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey.[1] The company is best known for its Pantone Matching System (PMS), a proprietary color space used in a variety of industries, notably graphic design, fashion design, product design, printing, and manufacturing and supporting the management of color from design to production, in physical and digital formats, among coated and uncoated materials, cotton, polyester, nylon and plastics. X-Rite, a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone for US$180 million in October 2007,[2] and was itself acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2012.[3] At the end of September 2023, Danaher made a spin-off of its Environmental and Applied Solutions segment as Veralto Corporation.[4] </p>
